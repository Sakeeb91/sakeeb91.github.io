                <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
                <p>
                    Financial markets behave like complex systems with distinct "moods" or regimes - sometimes they're calm and predictable, 
                    other times they're volatile and chaotic. Imagine if you could teach a computer to recognize these different market states 
                    the same way your brain recognizes faces or remembers patterns.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This project uses Hopfield networks - a type of neural network inspired by how memory works in the brain - to identify and 
                    classify different market regimes. It's like giving the computer a sophisticated pattern recognition system that can 
                    "remember" what different market conditions look like and identify them in real-time.
                </p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>What Are Market Regimes?</h3>
                <p>
                    Market regimes are distinct periods when markets behave in characteristically different ways. For example: 
                    bull markets (rising prices), bear markets (falling prices), high volatility periods (lots of price swings), 
                    or low volatility periods (stable prices). Each regime has different risk-return characteristics.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Why Traditional Methods Fall Short</h3>
                <p>
                    Most financial models assume markets behave consistently over time, but this simply isn't true. A strategy that works 
                    in a bull market might be disastrous in a bear market. Traditional statistical methods often miss the complex, 
                    non-linear patterns that characterize regime transitions.

            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Pattern Recognition Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Market regimes don't announce themselves - they must be inferred from subtle patterns in price movements, 
                    trading volumes, and other market indicators. This is exactly the kind of complex pattern recognition task 
                    that neural networks excel at.

            <h2 class="section-title">How Hopfield Networks Work</h2>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Inspired by Brain Memory</h3>
                <p>
                    Hopfield networks mimic how the brain stores and retrieves memories. Just as your brain can recognize a friend's face 
                    even in poor lighting or from an unusual angle, Hopfield networks can recognize market patterns even when they're 
                    noisy or incomplete. They store "memories" of different market states.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Content-Addressable Memory</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike computer memory that requires exact addresses, Hopfield networks use content-addressable memory - 
                    you can retrieve a complete memory from just a partial pattern. Show the network current market conditions, 
                    and it will "remember" which historical regime it most resembles.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Energy Landscape Metaphor</h3>
                <p>
                    Think of market regimes as valleys in a mountainous landscape. The network's "energy" represents how well 
                    current market conditions match known patterns. When the system finds a low-energy state (a valley), 
                    it has identified a stable market regime.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Self-Organizing Classification</h3>
                <p>
                    The network doesn't need to be told what regimes exist - it discovers them automatically by finding 
                    stable patterns in historical data. This unsupervised learning approach can reveal market regimes 
                    that human analysts might miss.

                <h3>Risk Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Different market regimes require different risk management strategies. During high volatility regimes, 
                    you might reduce position sizes or increase hedging. During trending regimes, you might increase allocations 
                    to momentum strategies. The system provides early warning of regime changes.

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Portfolio Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    Asset correlations change dramatically between regimes. What seems like a well-diversified portfolio in one regime 
                    might be highly concentrated risk in another. Regime-aware portfolio optimization can adapt allocations 
                    based on current market conditions.

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Trading Strategy Selection</h3>
                <p>
                    Different trading strategies perform better in different regimes. Trend-following strategies excel in trending markets, 
                    while mean-reversion strategies work better in range-bound markets. The system can automatically select 
                    the most appropriate strategy for current conditions.

            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Stress Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional stress tests often miss the most dangerous scenarios - regime transitions. By understanding 
                    how regimes evolve and interact, financial institutions can better prepare for the kinds of market shifts 
                    that cause the most damage.

                <p>
                    The system analyzes patterns across multiple time scales simultaneously - from intraday movements to 
                    long-term trends. This multi-scale approach captures both short-term volatility clustering and 
                    long-term structural changes in market behavior.

                <p>
                    Financial data is notoriously noisy, with random fluctuations that can confuse pattern recognition systems. 
                    The Hopfield network's attractor dynamics naturally filter out noise while preserving genuine regime signals, 
                    making classifications more reliable.

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Real-Time Processing</h3>
                <p>
                    Once trained, the network can classify market regimes in real-time as new data arrives. This speed is crucial 
                    for practical trading applications where regime changes must be detected quickly to be actionable.

                <p>
                    Unlike black-box machine learning models, Hopfield networks provide interpretable results. You can examine 
                    which market indicators are most important for regime classification and understand why the system 
                    makes particular classifications.

                    Pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds managing billions of dollars need sophisticated tools 
                    to navigate changing market conditions. Regime awareness can significantly improve long-term investment outcomes
