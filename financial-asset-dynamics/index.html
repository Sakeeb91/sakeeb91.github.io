                <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
                <p>
                    When hedge funds and investment banks make billion-dollar decisions, they rely on sophisticated mathematical models 
                    and quantitative analysis tools that aren't available to most investors. These institutions employ teams of PhD-level 
                    quantitative analysts (quants) who develop advanced algorithms for pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Financial Asset Dynamics is a comprehensive Python library that democratizes these institutional-grade quantitative finance tools. 
                    It's like having a team of Wall Street quants at your fingertips - providing the same mathematical rigor and analytical 
                    power used by the world's most successful financial institutions.

                <h3>Beyond Basic Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Simple buy-and-hold strategies and basic technical analysis are no longer sufficient in today's complex markets. 
                    Modern finance requires sophisticated mathematical models that can handle multiple assets, complex derivatives, 
                    non-normal return distributions, and dynamic risk management. This level of analysis requires advanced quantitative tools.
                </p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Institutional Advantage</h3>
                <p>
                    Large institutions have significant advantages: access to expensive Bloomberg terminals, teams of quantitative analysts, 
                    and proprietary trading systems. They use advanced mathematics to identify opportunities, manage risk, and optimize portfolios 
                    in ways that aren't available to smaller players.

                <h3>Data Complexity</h3>
                <p>
                    Financial markets generate massive amounts of complex data: price movements, volatilities, correlations, economic indicators, 
                    and sentiment measures. Making sense of this data requires sophisticated statistical techniques and mathematical models 
                    that can extract meaningful signals from noise.

                <p>
                    Goes far beyond simple mean-variance optimization to include factors like transaction costs, liquidity constraints, 
                    and regulatory limits. Implements cutting-edge techniques like Black-Litterman models, risk parity approaches, 
                    and robust optimization that work reliably in practice, not just in textbooks.

                <p>
                    Provides institutional-quality risk metrics including Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), 
                    maximum drawdown analysis, and stress testing. These tools help you understand not just expected returns, 
                    but the full spectrum of potential outcomes and their probabilities.

                    Implements the Black-Scholes model and its extensions for pricing options and other derivatives. 
                    Calculates the "Greeks" (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) that professional traders use to understand 
                    how option values change with market conditions. Essential for sophisticated hedging strategies.

                    Automatically identifies different market environments (bull markets, bear markets, high volatility periods) 
                    using statistical techniques. This regime awareness allows for dynamic strategy adjustment - 
                    using momentum strategies in trending markets and mean-reversion strategies in range-bound markets.

                <p>
                    Decomposes portfolio returns to understand what's driving performance: market exposure, sector allocation, 
                    security selection, or timing decisions. This analysis is crucial for understanding whether returns come from 
                    skill or luck, and for improving future investment decisions.

                <p>
                    Uses advanced simulation techniques to model thousands of potential market scenarios, providing robust estimates 
                    of risk and return. This probabilistic approach gives you a much richer understanding of potential outcomes

                    Implements multi-factor models (like Fama-French) to understand systematic risk exposures and identify 
                    genuine alpha generation. This analysis helps separate skill-based returns from compensation for bearing 
                    systematic risk factors, crucial for performance evaluation and attribution.
