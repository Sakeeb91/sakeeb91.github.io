                <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional risk management systems use fixed rules: "Never risk more than 2% on a single trade" or "Close all positions when the market falls 10%." 
                    But markets are dynamic - what's risky in calm periods might be conservative during crises, and vice versa. 
                    Fixed rules often fail exactly when you need them most.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    EACTO (Entropy-Adaptive Cybernetic Threshold Optimizer) is an intelligent risk management system that adapts its risk thresholds 
                    based on market complexity and uncertainty. It's like having a smart thermostat for your financial risk - 
                    automatically adjusting to changing conditions to maintain optimal protection.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Problem with Static Risk Management</h2>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>One Size Doesn't Fit All Markets</h3>
                <p>
                    A 1% daily move in a stable market might signal danger, while the same move during a crisis might be perfectly normal. 
                    Static risk models can't distinguish between these scenarios, leading to either excessive conservatism (missing opportunities) 
                    or inadequate protection (suffering unexpected losses).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Markets Change Faster Than Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Financial institutions often update their risk models quarterly or annually, but market conditions can change overnight. 
                    By the time humans recognize a shift and adjust the rules, significant damage may already be done. 
                    Automated, real-time adaptation is essential.

                <h3>The Paradox of Risk Measurement</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional risk measures (like Value-at-Risk) work well in normal times but break down during crises - 
                    exactly when accurate risk measurement is most crucial. This is like having a fire alarm that only works when there's no fire.

            <h2 class="section-title">How EACTO Works</h2>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Entropy as a Market Complexity Measure</h3>
                <p>
                    EACTO uses information theory concepts to measure market "entropy" - essentially how chaotic or unpredictable the market is. 
                    High entropy indicates complex, hard-to-predict conditions requiring more conservative risk thresholds. 
                    Low entropy suggests stable conditions where you can afford to take more risk.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Cybernetic Control Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    Borrowing from engineering control theory, EACTO implements feedback loops that continuously monitor market conditions 
                    and adjust risk parameters. Like a cruise control system that adapts to road conditions, it maintains your desired risk level 
                    despite changing market environments.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Dynamic Threshold Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    Rather than using fixed risk limits, EACTO optimizes thresholds in real-time based on current market complexity. 
                    During calm periods, it might allow larger position sizes. During volatile periods, it automatically tightens controls. 
                    This dynamic approach maximizes returns while maintaining consistent risk exposure.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Multi-Scale Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    The system analyzes market complexity across multiple time horizons - from minute-by-minute fluctuations to 
                    longer-term structural changes. This comprehensive view ensures that both short-term volatility spikes and 
                    gradual regime shifts are properly incorporated into risk decisions.

                <h3>Adaptive Risk Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Automatically adjusts risk tolerance based on market conditions. During stable periods, captures more upside by allowing 
                    larger positions. During uncertain periods, provides enhanced protection by tightening risk controls. 
                    This balance maximizes risk-adjusted returns.

                <h3>Early Warning System</h3>
                <p>
                    Rising market entropy often precedes major market dislocations. EACTO can detect these early warning signs and 
                    proactively reduce risk exposure before problems become apparent to traditional risk measures. 
                    This forward-looking approach prevents rather than just reacts to losses.

                <h3>Robust Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike models that work well in backtests but fail in practice, EACTO is designed for real-world robustness. 
                    It handles market microstructure effects, data quality issues, and regime changes that commonly derail academic models 
                    when deployed in practice.

                <p>
                    Provides auditable, quantitative justification for risk management decisions. Regulators increasingly expect 
                    dynamic risk management that adapts to changing conditions rather than static rules that may be obsolete. 
                    EACTO provides the documentation and rationale needed for regulatory approval.

                    This real-time capability ensures that risk management remains effective even during rapid market transitions
