                <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered why weather prediction is limited to about 10 days, or why some simple mathematical equations can produce 
                    incredibly complex, seemingly random behavior? This project explores the fascinating world of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Chaotic Systems Analysis is a comprehensive Python toolkit that helps researchers, engineers, and scientists analyze complex dynamical systems 
                    that exhibit chaotic behavior. Think of it as a powerful microscope for understanding the hidden patterns in seemingly random phenomena.
                </p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>What Makes a System Chaotic?</h3>
                <p>
                    Chaos doesn't mean random - it's actually deterministic behavior that's extremely sensitive to initial conditions. 
                    A tiny change in starting conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes. This is often called the "butterfly effect" - 
                    where a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could theoretically influence weather patterns in Texas.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
                <p>
                    Chaotic behavior appears everywhere: stock market fluctuations, population dynamics, cardiac arrhythmias, laser dynamics, 
                    climate systems, and even the dripping of a faucet. Understanding these systems helps us predict their behavior within limits 
                    and sometimes control them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Why Traditional Analysis Fails</h3>
                <p>
                    Linear mathematical tools (like simple averages or linear regression) completely miss the rich structure in chaotic systems. 
                    You need specialized techniques to uncover the hidden order within the apparent chaos.

            <h2 class="section-title">Powerful Analysis Tools</h2>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Fractal Dimension Calculation</h3>
                <p>
                    Measures how complex the system's behavior is by calculating how the system fills space. A fractal dimension between 2 and 3 
                    often indicates chaotic behavior. This is like measuring the "roughness" of the system's trajectory through its state space.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Lyapunov Exponents</h3>
                <p>
                    These numbers tell you how quickly nearby trajectories diverge from each other - essentially measuring the "strength" of chaos. 
                    Positive Lyapunov exponents indicate chaos, while negative ones suggest the system settles into predictable patterns.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Phase Space Reconstruction</h3>
                <p>
                    Even if you can only measure one variable from a complex system (like just temperature from a complex climate model), 
                    this technique can reconstruct the full dynamics. It's like inferring the entire dance from watching just one dancer's shadow.

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Poincaré Maps</h3>
                <p>
                    These create simplified 2D snapshots of complex multi-dimensional behavior, helping visualize patterns that would be 
                    impossible to see otherwise. Think of it as taking strategic snapshots of a complex 3D dance to understand the choreography.

                    Real-world data is always noisy. The toolkit includes advanced filtering and denoising techniques specifically designed 
                    for chaotic systems, where traditional smoothing can destroy the very features you're trying to study.
