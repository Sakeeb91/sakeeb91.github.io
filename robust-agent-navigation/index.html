                <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you're trying to navigate through a slippery ice rink to reach the other side, but every step you take 
                    has a chance of sending you sliding in an unintended direction. How would you learn the safest and most efficient 
                    path when you can't be sure your movements will go as planned?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This project demonstrates how an AI agent learns to navigate through uncertain environments using Q-learning, 
                    a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent must find optimal paths to its goal while dealing with 
                    movement uncertainty, obstacles, and hazards - just like navigating through real-world situations where things 
                    don't always go according to plan.

                <h3>Stochastic Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike deterministic environments where actions always produce predictable outcomes, this agent operates in 
                    a stochastic world. When it tries to move in one direction, there's only an 80-90% chance it will actually 
                    go that way - the rest of the time, it might slip or drift in a different direction.

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Learning Under Uncertainty</h3>
                <p>
                    The agent must learn to deal with this uncertainty by developing robust strategies. It can't just memorize 
                    a fixed path - it needs to understand the probability distributions of its actions and adapt its policy 
                    to handle the unpredictability of movement.

                <h3>Obstacle Avoidance</h3>
                <p>
                    The environment contains obstacles and hazards that the agent must learn to avoid. Since movement is 
                    uncertain, the agent must be extra careful near dangerous areas, developing conservative strategies 
                    that account for the possibility of unintended movements.

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Trial and Error Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent learns by trying different actions 
                    and observing their outcomes. Through repeated interactions with the environment, it builds up a "Q-table" 
                    that estimates the value of taking each action in each state.

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Exploration vs. Exploitation</h3>
                <p>
                    The agent uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration (trying new actions to learn more about 
                    the environment) with exploitation (using known good actions to maximize rewards). This balance is crucial 
                    for finding optimal policies in uncertain environments.

            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Policy Adaptation</h3>
                <p>
                    As the agent learns, it continuously updates its policy based on new experiences. The algorithm handles 
                    the stochastic nature of the environment by averaging outcomes over many trials, gradually converging 
                    to robust navigation strategies.

                <p>
                    The project includes comprehensive visualization tools that show how the agent's performance improves over time. 
                    Reward curves demonstrate learning progress, while policy heatmaps reveal the agent's preferred actions 
                    in different states of the environment.

                    The 6x6 grid environment can be easily modified to test different scenarios. You can adjust the slip probability, 
                    add or remove obstacles, change reward structures, and experiment with different levels of environmental uncertainty 
                    to see how the agent adapts.

                    The code is written with clarity and educational value in mind. Each component is well-documented, making it 
                    an excellent resource for understanding reinforcement learning concepts, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), 
                    and how to implement robust policies in practice.

                <p>
                    The principles demonstrated here apply directly to robotics, where sensors are noisy and actuators are imprecise. 
                    Autonomous vehicles, drones, and mobile robots all face similar challenges of navigating through uncertain 
                    environments while avoiding obstacles.

                    Game developers use similar techniques to create intelligent NPCs that can navigate complex environments and 
                    adapt to changing conditions. The stochastic nature makes the AI behavior more realistic and challenging.
